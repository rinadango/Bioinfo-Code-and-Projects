# Bioinfo Code and Projects

Miscellaneous code used for bioinformatics purposes:

- `Web Database Search`: this folder has several scripts for analyses, which scrapes databases.
- `Target sequence analysis [PROJECT]`: this folder has an extensive project Jupyter Notebook and input file, which holds target sequences. The objective of this project is to analyse these target sequences to discover what proteins the organism produces and how they differ from the corresponding proteins in other species.
